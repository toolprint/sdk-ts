## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ Intelligent Tool Selection

- **Semantic Search**: Find the right tools based on natural language descriptions and agent goals
- **Context Training**: Train custom tool contexts to improve selection accuracy for your specific use cases
- **Feedback Learning**: Selection gets smarter over time by learning from agent interactions and success patterns
- **Adaptive Ranking**: Tools are ranked based on historical performance and contextual relevance

### üîå Universal Connectivity

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Connect to any [supported provider](#supported-providers) through a single unified API
- **Type-Safe Integration**: Full TypeScript support with type definitions for all API operations
- **Simple Authentication**: Unified authentication handling across all providers
- **Provider Agnostic**: Write code once, switch providers anytime
- **OpenAPI Integration** `coming soon`: Register any OpenAPI server as a tool source automatically

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Control

- **Guardrails & Access Control**: Configure tool execution rules and approval flows - from automatic execution to human-in-the-loop oversight
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all tool selections and executions
- **Network Security**: Secure HTTPS connections with JWT and API key-based authentication schemes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Join the Sandbox

1. **Request Access**

   - Visit [onegrep.dev](https://www.onegrep.dev/) to join the waitlist
   - You'll receive an invite to the OneGrep sandbox environment

2. **Install the CLI**

```bash
# Install the OneGrep CLI
npx -y @onegrep/cli

# Create your account
npx @onegrep/cli account
# Select "Create Account" when prompted
```

### Sandbox Environment

The OneGrep sandbox comes pre-configured with:

- A collection of popular AI tools across different categories (chat, search, code analysis, etc.)
- Example tool contexts trained for common agent scenarios
- Pre-configured security policies and guardrails
- Sample agent implementations using different frameworks

> _A special thanks to [**Blaxel**](https://blaxel.ai/) for providing hosting services for MCP servers for the OneGrep Sandbox._

### Exploring the Sandbox

Let's try out some common workflows using the CLI:

#### 1. Search for Tools

Find tools that match your agent's goals using natural language:

```bash
# Start the CLI tool explorer
npx @onegrep/cli tools

# Select "search" from the menu
# Enter your query when prompted:
"I want to be able to find recent issues in the MCP repository and what the web says about how to fix them"

# The CLI will return ranked tools matching your query
```

#### 2. Execute Tools

Try out tools directly from the CLI:

```bash
# Start the CLI tool explorer
npx @onegrep/cli tools

# Select "Explore integrations"
# Select "exa" from the list
# Enter your query when prompted:
"what are the recent developments in MCP"

# The tool will execute and return results
```

#### 3. Train Tool Context

Improve tool selection by adding custom context:

```bash
# Start the CLI tool explorer
npx @onegrep/cli tools

# Select "Explore integrations"
# Select any tool
# Choose "Add property"
# Create a new property (e.g., "use_case")
# Add a value (e.g., "mcp monitoring")

# Now search again:
npx @onegrep/cli tools
# Select "search"
# Try a query related to your tag:
"I need to monitor MCP status"

# Your trained tool should appear at the top of the results
```

### Using the SDK

Once you have sandbox access, install the SDK:

```bash
# Install using PNPM
pnpm add @onegrep/sdk
```

Set up your environment:

```bash
# Get your API key from the CLI
npx @onegrep/cli account
# Select "Show authentication status"
# Your API key will be displayed

# Set the API key in your environment
export ONEGREP_API_KEY="your_sandbox_api_key"
# Set the URL to your onegrep deployment (or the public sandbox)
export ONEGREP_API_URL="https://test-sandbox.onegrep.dev"
```

#### Run an Agent

Let's start with a complete example of running an agent that uses OneGrep for dynamic tool selection. This example uses [**Langchain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) for the agent loop and [**Blaxel**](https://blaxel.ai/) for managing the agent runtime.

First, install the [**Just**](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner:

```bash
brew install just
just install
just build
```

Then run the example agent:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the agent server
just bl-serve

# Terminal 2: Open a chat session with the agent
just bl-chat
```

This will start a local agent that:

- Uses OneGrep SDK for intelligent tool selection
- Implements a ReAct agent loop with LangChain
- Runs in a secure Blaxel runtime environment

#### LangChain Integration

OneGrep seamlessly integrates with LangChain, providing type-safe tool bindings:

```typescript
import { getToolbox } from '@onegrep/sdk'
import { createLangchainToolbox } from '@onegrep/sdk/extensions/langchain'

// Initialize toolboxes
const toolbox = await getToolbox()
const langchainToolbox = await createLangchainToolbox(toolbox)

// Search for relevant tools based on your agent's goals
const searchResults = await toolbox.search(
  'Find recent news about AI developments'
)

// Tools are already structured for LangChain
const tools = searchResults.map((result) => result.result)

// Use in your LangChain agent
const agent = await createReactAgent({
  llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
  tools: tools,
  prompt: 'Use the most relevant tools to find and analyze AI news.'
})

// Tools are now available to your agent with proper typing and validation
const result = await agent.invoke({
  input: "What's the latest news about LangChain?"
})
```

## üîó Supported Providers

OneGrep integrates with the following tool providers:

### [Blaxel](https://blaxel.ai)

A computing platform for agentic AI that delivers the services and infrastructure needed to build and deploy AI agents. Blaxel has a wide range of pre-built tool servers and supports custom tool deployment.

### [Smithery](https://smithery.ai)

Smithery is a platform that helps developers find and deploy AI agent-compatible services that follow the Model Context Protocols (MCP) specification. It serves as a central hub for discovering and hosting MCP servers, with the goal of making agentic services more accessible.

```bash
Error: Failed to authenticate with OneGrep API
```

- Ensure `ONEGREP_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- Verify your API key is valid by running `npx @onegrep/cli account`
- Check if your API URL is correct (`ONEGREP_API_URL`)

#### Tool Not Found

```typescript
Error: Web search tool not found
```

- Confirm you have access to the required provider (Blaxel/Smithery)
- Check if the tool name matches exactly
- Try listing available tools: `await toolbox.listTools()`

#### Tool Execution Failures

```typescript
Error: Tool execution failed: Invalid input
```

- Verify input matches the tool's schema
- Check network connectivity to the tool provider
- Ensure you have necessary permissions
